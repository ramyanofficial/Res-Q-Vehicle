ABSTRACT

The project aims to create an autonomous AI-integrated rescue vehicle to locate and assist people 
trapped under landslide debris. Using AI, GPS, image recognition, and obstacle detection, the vehicle 
will detect and differentiate between living individuals and bodies. It will relay this information via 
GPS, showing the location of survivors as green dots and deceased as red dots on a map for rescuers. 
This unmanned system improves safety by allowing exploration in hazardous zones without human 
risk, speeding up rescue efforts. The vehicle uses AI algorithms to identify humans and objects, and 
GPS technology ensures accurate location tracking. Obstacle detection systems such as LiDAR, 
ultrasonic sensors, and image recognition help the vehicle navigate around debris, and a manual 
joystick control provides backup when the battery is low. The key benefits include faster response 
times, improved safety, and precise location tracking, which reduces search time. The project is viable 
due to the availability of proven technologies like AI, GPS, and sensors that can be implemented at a 
relatively low cost. Feasibility is ensured by the use of commercially available components and 
established algorithms, making it possible to build a working prototype within a reasonable timeframe. 
The systemâ€™s modular design allows for scalability, making it adaptable to various disaster scenarios, 
further enhancing its practicality and application.
